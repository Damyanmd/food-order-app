## Features

This application was created as a part of Udemy course. Design to look like a standard food order API. The first thing the user sees is the menu from which he/she can choose the meals and how much he wants and from 'Your Cart' can see the amount.

## Update

13.11.2022 - new logic added. Now all the information is saved into firebase. Plus there is now a checkout in where we can enter: name, city, street, postal code (it has to be 5 digits) and all of these fields have client validation.
